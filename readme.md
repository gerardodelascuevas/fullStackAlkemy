This is my solution for the Alkemy FullStack JavaScript challenge 

The app can save the userÂ´s data of movements of money, the user can add new movments, delete a movement and edit any movement. Also, the app can manage more than one user. 

To use the app, you need to clone the repository and make an npm i in both folders: Client and API.
You need PostgreSQl and make an .env to set the enviroment variables: DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST and DB_NAME. Use your postgreSQL user and create a database for the app. 

In landing you can access to register page to use the app, after using the app you can access your account in the landing. The app save all the movments that you charge and shows you a balance
